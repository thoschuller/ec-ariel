    Method described in the paper
    `Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing

    .. math::

        y = \\frac{x - \\mathrm{E}[x]}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[x] + \\epsilon}} * \\gamma + \\beta

    The mean and standard-deviation are calculated per-dimension over
    the mini-batches and :math:`\\gamma` and :math:`\\beta` are learnable parameter vectors
    of size `C` (where `C` is the number of features or channels of the input). By default, the
    elements of :math:`\\gamma` are set to 1 and the elements of :math:`\\beta` are set to 0.
    At train time in the forward pass, the variance is calculated via the biased estimator,
    equivalent to ``torch.var(input, unbiased=False)``. However, the value stored in the
    moving average of the variance is calculated via the unbiased  estimator, equivalent to
    ``torch.var(input, unbiased=True)``.

    Also by default, during training this layer keeps running estimates of its
    computed mean and variance, which are then used for normalization during
    evaluation. The running estimates are kept with a default :attr:`momentum`
    of 0.1.

    If :attr:`track_running_stats` is set to ``False``, this layer then does not
    keep running estimates, and batch statistics are instead used during
    evaluation time as well.

    .. note::
        This :attr:`momentum` argument is different from one used in optimizer
        classes and the conventional notion of momentum. Mathematically, the
        update rule for running statistics here is
        :math:`\\hat{x}_\\text{new} = (1 - \\text{momentum}) \\times \\hat{x} + \\text{momentum} \\times x_t`,

        Args:
            module (nn.Module): module containing one or more :attr:`BatchNorm*D` layers
            process_group (optional): process group to scope synchronization,

            The original :attr:`module` with the converted :class:`torch.nn.SyncBatchNorm`
            layers. If the original :attr:`module` is a :attr:`BatchNorm*D` layer,
            a new :class:`torch.nn.SyncBatchNorm` layer object will be returned
            instead.
