def allreduce_hook(process_group: dist.ProcessGroup, bucket: dist.GradBucket) -> torch.futures.Future[torch.Tensor]:
    """
    Call ``allreduce`` using ``GradBucket`` tensors.

    Once gradient tensors are aggregated across all workers, its ``then``
    callback takes the mean and returns the result.

    If user registers this DDP communication hook,
    DDP results is expected to be same as the case where no hook was registered.
    Hence, this won't change behavior of DDP and user can use this as a reference
    or modify this hook to log useful information or any other purposes while
    unaffecting DDP behavior.

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> ddp_model.register_comm_hook(process_group, allreduce_hook)

    Compress by casting ``GradBucket`` to ``torch.float16`` divided by process group size.

    This DDP communication hook implements a simple gradient compression

    and then divides it by the process group size.
    It allreduces those ``float16`` gradient tensors. Once compressed gradient
    tensors are allreduced, the chained callback ``decompress`` casts it back to the input data type (such as ``float32``).
